# Medium
# Maximum Product Subarray

# Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
# The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
# Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

# Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]            Output: 6
# Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]             Output: 0
